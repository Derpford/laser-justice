# LASER JUSTICE
An arcade score-attack mod for GZDoom

# HOW TO PLAY

## CONTROLS
FIRE - Fire your weapon. Collect UPGRADE TOKENS to unlock its true potential.
ALTFIRE - Use a Bomb. Bombs stun nearby enemies and deflect projectiles. You gain another Bomb every time your multiplier reaches a multiple of 5.
RUN - Tap the run button to perform a DODGE. Performing a DODGE gives you some invulnerability frames. Use a DODGE while moving to get lots of speed.
* With good timing (3 frame window) you can perform a LASER DODGE and set off a mini-bomb.
* Press RUN while jumping to boost yourself into the air!

## WEAPON UPGRADES
- LASER BEAM - Your Laser Gun's base state. A single, rapid-fire blast.
- DUAL LASER - A rapid-firing laser blast! Slightly more damage than the LASER BEAM, spread across twin beams.
- LONG LASER - A slower, but more powerful beam, optimized for long-distance combat. Does more damage from afar, but not as much at point-blank range. Mind your spacing!
- WIDE LASER - A shotgun-like spread of beams, favored by the Hard Corps and modified to have similar range to your other attacks. A close-range powerhouse.
- BUSTER LASER - A shot that lingers on impact, doing damage in an area over time. Melts crowds of smaller enemies, and does respectable damage to larger ones.
- OMEGA BEAM - Combining aspects of the LONG LASER, the BUSTER LASER, and the DUAL LASER, this is the most powerful weapon in your arsenal.

## ITEMS
COINS - Grant you varying amounts of POINTS. Stack up a high MULTIPLIER by killing monsters without taking hits, and make those points go even further beyond!
UPGRADE TOKENS - Every 200 UPGRADE TOKENS grants you a new weapon!
HEALTH - Collect HEALTH pickups to keep your HEALTH BONUS up. You cannot die, but a high Health Bonus is good for your score--it makes your Multiplier go up faster!
SHIELD TOKENS - SHIELD TOKENS not only protect you from damage, they also stop your multiplier from going down! Every 10 SHIELD TOKENS blocks 1 attack.
DEFLECTOR ORB - Deflector Orbs orbit you and deflect incoming attacks.
BAG OF COINS - Pick one of these up to create a shower of coins!
GUNLIMITER - Obtain GUNLIMITED POWER for a brief period of time! Also heals you and grants a free upgrade!

## TIPS AND TRICKS
1. Use your bombs! They're easier to get than Shield Tokens, and far more powerful if you use them wisely. Bombs stunlock enemies and save your from incoming projectiles.
2. If you're out of bombs, use your dodge! Performing a Laser Dodge will increase your multiplier, too!
3. Just Don't Get Hit! Taking a hit halves your score, halves your multiplier, *and* reduces your Health Bonus. The less you get hit, the higher your score will go.
