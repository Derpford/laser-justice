# LASER JUSTICE
An arcade score-attack mod for GZDoom

# HOW TO PLAY

## CONTROLS
FIRE - Fire your weapon. Collect UPGRADE TOKENS to unlock its true potential.
ALTFIRE - Use a Bomb. Bombs stun nearby enemies and deflect projectiles. You gain another Bomb every time your multiplier goes up.
RUN - Tap the run button to perform a DODGE. Performing a DODGE gives you some invulnerability frames. Use a DODGE while moving to get lots of speed.
* With good timing (3 frame window) you can perform a LASER DODGE and set off a mini-bomb.
* Press RUN while jumping to boost yourself into the air!

## ITEMS
COINS - Grant you varying amounts of POINTS. Stack up a high MULTIPLIER by killing monsters without taking hits, and make those points go even further beyond!
UPGRADE TOKENS - Every 200 UPGRADE TOKENS grants you a new weapon!
HEALTH - Collect HEALTH pickups to keep your HEALTH BONUS up. You cannot die, but you do get bonus points for being healthy!
SHIELD TOKENS - SHIELD TOKENS not only protect you from damage, they also stop your multiplier from going down! Every 10 SHIELD TOKENS blocks 1 attack.
